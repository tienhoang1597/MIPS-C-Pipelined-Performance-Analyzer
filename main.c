 /*
main file to structure all of the oher files around
ECE 5367 Final Project: Pipelined Performance Analyzer

most of this information is sourced from:

Structure for the code
1) parse the file, store the instructions in memory in memory
2) have a structure for input parameters of the computer thats running like clock rate and instructions per cycle, the math stuff, along with what structure the pipeline will have
3) attempt to execute, have notes for any errors or hazards that could occur, (maybe this needs to be in half steps, but 5 full steps looking forward minimum is required i think)
4) take steps 2 and 3s information along with number of instructions from step 1 to calculate the output and compare the computers we are testing
5) print it all into an output file and make it pretty?
